The eventual number again fell within the uncertainty bounds, at 5.35 million sq km.\\nBut unlike the 2013 forecast, this year's projection was made publicly in advance.  The polar modelling community was watching.\\nThe projection of 5.4 million sq km (4.9-5.9 million sq km) was technically for the \"September average\" extent. This number will be known in a few days, but is likely to be more than 5.02 and therefore even closer to the Reading forecast.\\n\"The fact that we have this repeated success lends some confidence,\" Prof Daniel Feltham from the NERC Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at Reading told BBC News.\\n\"We have error bars, and we can describe skill as being between one and zero, where one is perfect and zero is terrible. We're about 0.4 or 0.5.\\n\"That may not sound very good, but it's still a lot better than anything else that's out there,\" he explained.\\nAs the sun rises in the Arctic in the spring, the sea ice starts to melt and water will begin to pond on top of the floes. This will change the pack's reflectiveness, or albedo.\\nThe ponds are darker than the bare ice and therefore absorb more of the Sun's energy, driving further melting.\\nProf Feltham's team has developed a model to forecast the evolution of melt ponds in the Arctic and has incorporated this into more general climate sea-ice models.\\nSatellite records show that the year with smallest pond fraction in late spring (11% in 1996) had the biggest sea ice extent in September; and the year with the largest pond fraction (34% in 2012) featured the all-time low extent come the autumn.\\n\"There is a fundamental limit to how skilful we can be with this,\" said Prof Feltham.\\n\"If we're making a prediction for September in the spring, it means we've still got to contend with a few months of weather, and we can't capture all the natural variability in the system.\"\\nProf Feltham described his team's work at a major UK Royal Society conference on the Arctic this week.\\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</td>\n",
